  """Search for historical data in Digital Threat Monitoring (DTM) using Lucene syntax.

  Digital theat monitoring is a collection of documents from surface, deep, and dark web sources.

  To filter by document type or threat type, include the conditions within the `query` string
  using the fields `__type` and `label_threat`, respectively. Combine multiple conditions
  using Lucene boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT).

  Examples of filtering in the query:
  - Single document type: `(__type:forum_post) AND (body:security)`
  - Multiple document types: `(__type:(forum_post OR paste)) AND (body:security)`
  - Single threat type: `(label_threat:information-security/malware) AND (body:exploit)`
  - Multiple threat types: `(label_threat:(information-security/malware OR information-security/phishing)) AND (body:exploit)`
  - Combined: `(__type:document_analysis) AND (label_threat:information-security/information-leak/credentials) AND (body:password)`

  Important Considerations for Effective Querying:

  -   **Date/Time Filtering (`since` and `until`)**:
    -   Input parameters `since` and `until` filter documents by their creation/modification time.
    -   These must be strings in RFC3339 format, specifically ending with 'Z' to denote UTC.
    -   Example: `'2025-04-23T00:00:00Z'`

  -   **Pagination for More Than 25 Results**:
      -   A single API call returns at most `size` results (maximum 25).
      -   To retrieve more results, you must paginate:
          1.  Make your initial search request.
          2.  The response dictionary will contain a key named `page`.
          3.  If this `page` key holds a non-empty string value, there are more results available.
          4.  To fetch the next page, make a subsequent API call. This call MUST include the *exact same parameters* as your original request (query, size, since, until, doc_type, etc.), PLUS the `page` parameter set to the token value received in the previous response's `page` field.
          5.  Continue this process, using the new `page` token from each response, until the `page` field is absent or empty in the response, indicating the end of the results.

  Tokenization:
  - DTM breaks documents into tokens.
  - Example: "some-domain.com" -> "some", "domain", "com".
  - Wildcard/Regex queries match single tokens, not phrases.

  Special Characters:
  - Escape with \\: ` + - & | ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : / ` and space.
  - Example: To find "(1+1):2", query \(1\+1\)\:2

  Case Sensitivity:
  - DTM entity values are often lowercased.
  - Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) MUST be UPPERCASE.

  Domain Search Nuances:
  - Use wildcards/regex on fields like `doc.domain`.
  - Example: doc.domain:google.*.dev
  - Avoid pattern searches on `group_network`.

  Performance Limit:
  - Searches timeout after 60 seconds.
  - For broad or complex queries, it is highly recommended to use the `since` and `until` parameters to add time delimiters. This narrows the search scope and helps prevent timeouts.

  Noise Reduction:
  - Use typed entities for higher precision.
  - Example: organization:"Acme Corp"
  - Prefer typed entities over free text searches.
  
  The following fields and their meanings can be used to compose a query using Lucene syntax (including combining them with AND, OR, and NOT operators along with parentheses):
  * author.identity.name - The handle used by the forum post author
  * subject - The subject line of the forum post
  * body - The body text of the content
  * inet_location.url - What URL content was found 
  * language - The content language
  * title - The title of the web page 
  * channel.name - The Telegram channel name
  * domain - A DNS domain name
  * cve - A CVE entry by ID 

  __type: one of the following
  * web_content_publish - General website content
  * domain_discovery - Newly discovered domain names
  * forum_post - Darkweb forum posts
  * message - Chat messages like Telegram
  * paste - Paste site content like Pastebin
  * shop_listing - Items for sale on the dark web
  * email_analysis - Suspicious emails
  * tweet - Tweets from Twitter on cybersecurity topics.
  * document_analysis - Documents (PDF, Office, text) from VirusTotal, including malicious and corporate confidential files.

  label_threat: one of the following
  * information-security/anonymization - Anonymization
  * information-security/apt - Advanced Persistent Threat
  * information-security/botnet - Botnet
  * information-security/compromised - Compromised Infrastructure
  * information-security/doxing - Personal Information Disclosure
